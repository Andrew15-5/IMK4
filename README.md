# IMK4 - place where all important files are stored

Here you can find lab files and corresponding data (if provided),
as well as books.

>Note: books are archived (in parts) because their names contain cyrillic
characters and these files are poorly displayed in git. Also big files
(i.e. books archived by whole semester instead of parts) are harder to maintain.

Repository acronyms and abbreviations:

* IMK - Informatics and Management Kaluga
* mdpl - Machine-dependent programming languages
* hlp - High-level programming
* lab - laboratory work
