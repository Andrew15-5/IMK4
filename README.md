# IMK4 - place where all important files are stored

Here you can find lab files and corresponding data (if provided),
as well as books, lectures and more.

Repository acronyms and abbreviations:

* IMK - Informatics and Management Kaluga
* mdpl - Machine-dependent programming languages
* hlp - High-level programming
* dm - Discrete Mathematics
* foe - Fundamentals of electronics
* lab - laboratory work

## Notes

Books are archived (in parts) because their names contain cyrillic
characters and these files are poorly displayed in git. Also big files
(i.e. books archived by whole semester instead of parts) are harder to maintain.
You can find same unarchived books in <a href="#links">Links</a> section.

Every .doc(x)/.pptx file has a .pdf copy in pdf/ folder (which is located
in the same directory).\
.pdf files are generated using libreoffice:

```shell
libreoffice --convert-to pdf file.doc
```
